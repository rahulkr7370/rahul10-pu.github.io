      <h4><a href="https://github.com/rahul10-pu/mdc">Multiple Data Compresion and Decompression (MDC)</a></h4>
      <small>Uses basic C programming concepts and bit manupulation for data compression and decompression. Will do the MDC in iterative way i.e, Compressing the file in iterative way..as much as possible.</small>
      <h4><a href="https://github.com/rahul10-pu/Data-store-in-Structure-C">Store data in structure-C language</a></h4>
      <small>Store data using C language</small>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/rahul10-pu/CDD">Compress and Decompress Data</a> </h4>
      <small>A dynamic Huffman algorithm to compress and decompress data. It is mainly targeted to data with some symbols occurring more often than the rest (e.g., having some data file consisting of three different symbols, and their total number of occurrences in that file is s1(1000), s2(200), s3(30), so the total length of the file is 1000+200+30=1230 bytes; it is encoded, assigning one bit to s1 and two bits to s2, s3, so the encoded length is 1*1000+2*(200+30)=1460 bits=182 bytes). In the best case, a file consisting of just one symbol will be encoded with a compression ratio of 1:8. Huffman coding is used in image compression; however, in JPEG2000, an arithmetic codec is employed.</small>
